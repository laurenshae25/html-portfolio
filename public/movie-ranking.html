<h3>Apocalypto</h3>
<p>This action packed movie kept me on my toes the entire time.
    I am naturally drawn to the rainforest so I loved the overall 
    setting. The movie was very graphic which helped make the 
    story more realistic, causing it to affect my emotions.

<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>I loved the animation style of this movie, it was very pleasing
    to the eye. The writer took you on a journey and I liked the 
    little life lessons that were implemented.

<h3>Avatar</h3>
<p>Avatar also took place in a rainforest setting which I loved. 
    I like that it was a mix of animation and live action. The 
    magical dreamland was very unique.
